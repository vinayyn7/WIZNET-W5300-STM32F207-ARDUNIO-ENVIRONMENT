Ethernet-Enhanced LoRa Gateway: Minimizing Delay, Maximizing Security 
How To Use STM32F207ZG(NUCLEO-F207ZG)  with Wiznet ToE 5300 in the Project

Given the unavailability of the NUCLEO-F429ZI board, which is officially supported by the Wiznet W5300 library, it's prudent to consider alternative hardware options recommended by Wiznet. Here's a technical approach to finding suitable alternatives:

1. Review Wiznet's Compatibility Documentation: Carefully review Wiznet's official documentation, datasheets, and compatibility guides for the W5300 library. Look for mentions of compatible development boards, microcontrollers, or platforms that are recommended or certified for use with the W5300.

2. Check Microcontroller Compatibility: Verify if other STM32 microcontrollers are compatible with the W5300 library. Explore STM32 datasheets and reference manuals to identify microcontrollers with similar features and pin configurations as the NUCLEO-F429ZI.

3. Evaluate Hardware Availability: Investigate the current availability of alternative STM32 Nucleo boards or development kits that meet the compatibility criteria specified by Wiznet. Look for boards that offer Ethernet connectivity and support for the W5300 library.

4. Consider Evaluation Boards: Examine STM32 evaluation boards or development kits that include Ethernet connectivity. Some of these boards may align with Wiznet's recommendations and can be used as a suitable alternative to the NUCLEO-F429ZI.

By following these technical steps, you can make an informed decision regarding alternative hardware that aligns with Wiznet's recommendations and allows you to proceed with your project while ensuring compatibility with the W5300 library.

Wiznet W5300 Will work in the below listed Nucleo Boards

NUCLEO-F207ZG
NUCLEO-F429ZI
NUCLEO-F439ZI
NUCLEO-F722ZE
NUCLEO-F756ZG
NUCLEO-F767ZI

We need to Add [SRAM Enable] to the config file in order to make Wiznet W5300 Work with STM32F207 Using Arduino Libraries.

Open the stm32yyxx_hal_conf.h  from the folder
C:\Users\scarlet\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\STMicroelectronics\hardware\stm32\2.0.0\cores\arduino\stm32\stm32yyxx_hal_conf.h

Add The Below  line to the Code(Refer to the below-highlighted line to place )
#define HAL_SRAM_MODULE_ENABLED
 



Remove the existing FMC directory.

C:\Users_YOUR_NAME_\AppData\Local\Arduino15\libraries\FMC



Remove the existing FMC init code.


C:\Users_YOUR_NAME_\AppData\Local\Arduino15\libraries\Ethernet\w5100.cpp


FMC.init(); => //FMC.init();

successfully completed all the necessary configurations to enable the STM32F207 (NUCLEO-F207ZG) development board to operate seamlessly within the Arduino IDE environment. With this setup, we can now engage in advanced technical development, firmware programming, and deployment on the STM32F207 platform using the Arduino framework.
